PLACEHOLDER: Safety Warning Icon
=================================

This is a placeholder for safety warning icons.

When ready to implement:
- Replace with an actual icon file (PNG/SVG)
- Recommended size: 24x24dp or vector format
- Design: Shield with warning or safety badge
- Color: Orange/red for warnings, blue for safety tips

Current implementation uses Flutter's built-in Icons.warning_amber and shield icons
